## Implementation details
- Since there is many currencies with for example symbol Â£ (Pound sterling, Egyptian pound, Syrian pound,...) I have decided to let the program simply choose the first currency it finds in the currency dictionary (I could imagine a solution for example where certain currencies have bigger priority but as it was not specified I have chosen this solution)
- As per the web API output I have chosen to simply write out JSON as a text and not to parse it into HTML simply because of the JSON viewers every browser offers
