## Implementation details
- Since there is many currencies represented by, for example, symbol Â£ (Pound sterling, Egyptian pound, Syrian pound,...) I have decided to let the program simply choose the first currency it finds in the currencies dictionary (I could imagine a solution for example where certain currencies have bigger priority but as it was not specified I have chosen this solution)


## Docker
The reason I haven't put this application into docker container is that I was developing it on a Windows 10 home (Linux Bash Shell), which I found out (I have always used linux before which I currently don't have installed) does't support docker desktop and is not a very good friend with using docker in the windows provided Linux Bash Shell. I hope this fact won't result in a negative review of this project.
